# Iceberg Demo with Trino, Hive Metastore, PostgreSQL, and MinIO

This project demonstrates an OTF (Open Table Format) stack using the following components:

- **Iceberg**: Table format layer on top of the object store. Acts as a bridge between data lake (Minio) and the query engine (Trino)
    * Iceberg defines how table data and metadata are stored in the data lake (in this case, in MinIO).
    * Unlike Hive tables, which store just basic metadata in the Hive Metastore and organize data loosely, Iceberg manages schema evolution, partitioning, and versioning in a much more reliable way.


- **Trino**: A distributed SQL query engine, utilised with Iceberg connector in this project.  
    * Trino uses the Iceberg connector to read/write Iceberg tables stored in the MinIO object store.
    * Trino connects to Iceberg tables via the Hive Metastore.
    
- **Hive Metastore**: A metadata store for managing table schemas and locations.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the backend database for the Hive Metastore.
- **MinIO**: An S3-compatible object storage for storing Iceberg table data.

## What happens behind the scenes?

The following happens behind the scenes when you run a `CREATE TABLE` SQL in Trino:  

1. Trino parses the query and delegates to the Iceberg connector.  
2. The Iceberg connector:  

    * Writes table metadata in Iceberg format to s3a://warehouse/... (MinIO).
    * Registers the table in the Hive Metastore.

When querying the table with `SELECT` sql:  

1. The Iceberg connector fetches metadata from the warehouse directory.
2. It uses Icebergâ€™s metadata files (manifest lists, snapshots) to locate data files.
3. Trino reads the data files (e.g., Parquet) from MinIO.
